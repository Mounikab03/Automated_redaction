# REDACT: Automated Redaction with Encoder + PATE-GAN

**REDACT** is an AI-powered web app that automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) from PDF text using a combination of a custom encoder model, pre-trained Hugging Face transformers, and privacy-preserving techniques via PATE-GAN.

## Overview

"REDACT" addresses the critical need for protecting sensitive data in PDF documents by offering a machine learning-based solution designed for intelligent redaction. Users can choose between two powerful models depending on their redaction needs:

- **NER BERT-Based Model**  
  Leverages Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify sensitive data and replace it with a placeholder like `"******"`. Ideal for users who want to preserve the original document‚Äôs structure while obscuring sensitive content.

- **PATE-GAN Model**  
  Uses privacy-preserving GAN techniques to replace PII with contextually appropriate, realistic synthetic data. This ensures anonymization while maintaining the usability of the redacted document for analysis or collaboration.
